Hi Görkem,

Quick follow-up for Mobidictum Conference 2025 (21 to 22 October, Istanbul).

We recently implemented a feature to speed up speaker page production: a short bio generated from public sources with an AI tool. It is a starting point, not a final source of truth—we do not assume it is 100% accurate. We’d love your feedback on whether this helps the process.

Proposed short bio:  
Görkem Türk is the founding partner of Laton Ventures, the largest gaming- and apps-focused venture capital fund in Turkiye. Launched in February 2025, Laton closed its inaugural $50 million fund to support pre-seed and seed-stage gaming startups globally, with a strong emphasis on founders in Turkiye, the US, and Europe. Prior to founding Laton, Görkem spent six years as Industry Manager for Gaming, Apps & Startups at Google in Istanbul, where he led growth partnerships and ecosystem development in the gaming sector. Under Görkem’s leadership, Laton has invested in five early-stage companies within its first year—two of which have since secured Series A funding, including Grand Games, which raised $30 million in under nine months. Laton has also quickly risen to rank among the global top 10 most active early-stage gaming VCs.
