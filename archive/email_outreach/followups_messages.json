It is a starting point, not a final source of truth—we do not assume it is 100% accurate. We’d love your feedback on whether this helps the process.\n\nProposed short bio:\nWe don't currently have a bio on file. Please include a 2–3 sentence bio in the form link above, or reply with your own; we'll update it.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nPlease complete the speaker form by 15 September 2025 and include any edits you want to your bio:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/242603789142964\n\nYou can use the text as is, update it, or replace it with your own version.\n\nOptional feedback:\nIf you have a moment, a quick note like “works for me” or “I prefer to write my own” helps us improve this feature. I’ll be watching for your feedback.\n\nUseful details:\n• Sessions run between 10:00 and 16:00. Exact time and stage will follow.\n• Claim your Speaker ticket with code speaker2025 via the conference page:\nhttps://mobidictum.com/events/mobidictum-conference-2025/\n\n• Hotel discounts are listed on that page.\n• On 20 October, we host an Executive Mixer for Speakers and Executive ticket holders. You are welcome to join.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBest regards,\nSerdar\nMarketing Manager, Mobidictum\n",
